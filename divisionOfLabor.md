# Division of Labor

## Andrew
* line length detection tool
* total area detection tool
  * v1 complete

## Ali
* simulate ECoG data
* explore Simulink strategy

## Shayan


## Unassigned
* frequency/amplitude detection tool
* GUI design
* stimulation generation
* setting stimulation parameters based on user input
  * similar to how a clinician would increase values and set nominal settings to prevent false positive detections
* measure false positives, true positives, and false negatives
  * true negatives would just be no stim during regular ECoG
